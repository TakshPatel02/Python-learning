Best Practices:

Model Organization:
1. Define lead models first - models with no dependencies
2. Build upward - Gradually compose more complex models
3. Use clear naming - Make relationships obvious
4. Grooup related models - Keep models in logical modules/files

Performance Considerations:
1. Deep nesting impacts Performance - keep resonable depth
2. Large lists of nested models - Consider pagination
3. Circular references - user carefully , can cause memory issues
4. Lazy loading - Consider for expensive nested computations

Data Modeling Tips:
1. Model real-world relationships - Mirror your domain structure
2. Use optional appropriately - Not all relationships are required
3. Consider Union types - For polymorphic relationships
4. Validate business rules - Use model validators for cross-model logic
