==> datatypes in python:
    1) objects
    -> everything in python is an object
    -> every object has a unique identity , a type and a value
    -> id() function returns the identity of an object  
    -> type() function returns the type of an object
    -> value is the data stored in the object
    -> mutable objects : objects whose value can be changed (like lists , dictionaries)
    -> immutable objects : objects whose value cannot be changed (like strings , tuples)
    -> id helps to check if the object is mutable or immutable.
    -> we can check it by using the value but it is not a good practice.

    2) set data type:
    -> unordered collection of unique elements

    3) Number data type:
    -> int : integer values (positive and negative whole numbers)
    -> float : decimal values (positive and negative numbers with decimal points)
    -> complex : complex numbers (numbers with a real and imaginary part)
    -> bool : boolean values (True or False)
    -> NoneType : represents the absence of a value (None)
    -> we can use type() function to check the type of a variable.

    4) string data type:
