asyncio.run(fetch_order())

# In this example, the background_worker function runs in a separate daemon thread, continuously logging system health every second. Meanwhile , the main asyncio event loop runs the fetch_order coroutine, which simulates fetching an order with a 3-second delay. The background worker thread does not block the main event loop, allowing both tasks to run concurrently.
